# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help Roza, a biological researcher, complete the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard. Using JavaScript and Plotly, interactive charts were created to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. As a result, Roza's volunteers are able to filter to their respective ID and identify their top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. The bacterial data is displayed in a horizontal bar chart, bubble chart and a gauge chart in addition to the demographic information for each volunteer. 

With this, if **Improbable Beef** identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
