# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana, a data journalist, with her webpage of UFO sightings. Using JavaScript, a dynamic table was created allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. This includes filtering by date, city, state, country, and shape. Now, Dana's dynamic webpage can provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. 

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
